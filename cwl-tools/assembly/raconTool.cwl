label: Polishes raw contigs where the assembly method did not include a consensus step. Can also be used to polish a long read draft assembly with short reads.
doc: |
  Polishes raw contigs where the assembly method did not include a consensus step. Might also be used to polish a other assemblies with an additional set of reads (e.g. polish a canu nanopore assembly with illumina reads).
